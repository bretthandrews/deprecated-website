Title: Astrophysics

I seek to disentangle the twisted histories of galaxies, especially our own Milky Way, and quantitatively evaluate the importance of the physical processes that drive their evolution from violent youths to relaxed adults.

### Star Formation Feedback
Forming stars out of gas clouds _should_ be almost 100% efficient. It isn't.

We assembled a data set of star forming systems spanning orders of magnitude in size and intensity to understand why.

to assess the ability of photons from bright young stars to obliterate gas clouds and halt star formation.
